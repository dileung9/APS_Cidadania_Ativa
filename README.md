# APS_Cidadania_Ativa
This is a project for an end-of-semester college project. I developed this website using HTML and CSS. It was completely developed by me, and my goal is to show my evolutions in front-end programming. I am particularly proud of this project, and by sharing it with you I want to show my satisfaction with the work that has been done.
